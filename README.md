# social-network-alignment
GAN with tensorflow to realize social network alignment (supervised learning) 
Reproducing two mdoels: SNNAu AND SNNAo
See theories and algorithms in 'Adversarial Learning for Weakly-Supervised Social Network Alignment'
In 'SNNA' file, see details in 'README.md', run the code after data-preprocessing.
used Foursquare and Twitter as pair example

NOTE: I am sorry that I can't open the datasets as well as the preprocessing codes.
